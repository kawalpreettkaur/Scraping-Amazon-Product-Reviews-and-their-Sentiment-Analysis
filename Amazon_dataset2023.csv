Final review;- go if you're getting under 17k but keep in mind display is good but you'll get only 1080p in yt ,no heating issues,battery performance is also good,if your budget is tight and looking for brand value you can go for it.

AF64W2XMKVM2OD4RTXJTPMDE7Q2Q,B09WQY65HN,Abhinav,"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.
There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.
Pros:
1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.
2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet
3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.
4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.
Cons
1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.

Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.

AFB2FWPDSV3IQLNYYHJBPUFIQEWQ,B09WQY65HN,anju," Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matter

Display - Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as well

Performance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usage

Software- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos üòÇ but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better idea

Camera - Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent things

Battery - Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fast

Speakers - 6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate

5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristic

Call quality - Rating 10 : it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbled

So to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",4.0,A decent package for non gamers and everything thing is decent not the best out there,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800

AG6LZTYG777FXUPWXBFYZEWMC25A,B09WQY65HN,Anantha Krishnan,"Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:

Pros:
- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed
- Smooth performance and display
- Comparatively compact and light weight
- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)
- Design and color is neat

Cons:
- Speaker isn't great
- Camera is okayish
- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of now

Detailed:
- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.
- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.
- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.
- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.
- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.
- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.
- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).

Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.",5.0,A good choice for upgrade,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800

AFVVVQLHQEWRFVX4CED57OOMLKLA,B09WQY65HN,Rahul Talreja,"I got this phone for a relative of mine who's a grandma.
1. User-Friendly Interface: She appreciated the clean and straightforward interface of the Nord CE 2 Lite. Navigating through the menus was a breeze, and she quickly got the hang of it without needing any help.
2. Comfortable Design: The phone is a bit on the bigger side but it's lightweight design was perfect for the grandma's hands. She found it easy to hold and operate, even during long conversations.
3. Clear Display: The Nord CE 2 Lite's display impressed the grandma with its clarity and vibrant colors. Watching her favorite family videos and photos became a joy on this device.
4. Decent Camera: While not a photography enthusiast, the grandma found the camera quality to be more than sufficient for capturing precious moments with her grandchildren.
5. Reliable Performance: Nord CE 2 Lite handled everyday tasks smoothly, whether it was browsing the internet, sending messages, or making video calls. The grandma noticed minimal lag, which was a big plus.
6. No-Nonsense Features: The phone's limited pre-installed apps and bloatware-free experience were appreciated by the grandma. It saved her from the confusion of unnecessary apps cluttering the screen.
7. Affordable Price: It isn't a flag ship from One Plus but pretty close and it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket as well.
8. Learning Curve: While the overall experience was positive, the grandma did find it slightly challenging to get accustomed to certain gestures and settings initially. However, after a few days, it became second nature.

Overall, I'd say in current market, this is one of the phones you can go for without hesitation.",5.0,A Grandma's Delight: Nord CE 2 Lite Review,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800

AHSHOQ5VGW3XFJUL6RDHLSWJXUEA,B09WQY65HN,RITESH,"I got this mobile for ‚Çπ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.
Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ‚Çπ3000 discount.
Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.
Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.
Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.
Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.
O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.
Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.
Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.
Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.
Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.
Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.
Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.
GB ram is enough for daily operation.
My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ‚Çπ20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.",5.0,Mid ranger Flagship.,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800

AF64W2XMKVM2OD4RTXJTPMDE7Q2Q,B09WQY65HN,Abhinav,"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.
There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.
Pros:
1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.
2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet
3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.
4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.
Cons
1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.

Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.

AFB2FWPDSV3IQLNYYHJBPUFIQEWQ,B09WQY65HN,anju," Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matter

Display - Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as well

Performance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usage

Software- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos üòÇ but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better idea

Camera - Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent things

Battery - Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fast

Speakers - 6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate

5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristic

Call quality - Rating 10 : it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbled

So to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",4.0,A decent package for non gamers and everything thing is decent not the best out there,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800

AES37P3BPTHIG527GFKHR4QWUQUQ,B09WQY65HN,Sankar swaminathan,"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.

Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured. LED flash is average and could have been better.

The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.

Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4.0,Good phone-could have been better !,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800

AE4CY57AQH24XJIV7FHHDR7VIORQ,B09WQY65HN,Suhit,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of Usage

Design: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.

Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.

Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.

Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.

Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.

Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.

Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.",3.0,Average Phone. So keep average expectations.,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800
AFLM4WCQZU4G6E4TW4Q3GN5RXTEQ,B09WQY65HN,Sanjay Kumar,"Choosing OnePlus over Realme turned out to be the worst decision ever for me ! Almost everyone has Realme devices with us but thought of trying a new brand as it was namely good but turned out to be the wrong side of investment in this !
The camera is just the level of a jio phone..
Too much disappointed with the camera quality,pixel,AI and what not !
I previously used Realme 3 Pro and guess what that's far better than this !
I'd not recommend this phone to you guys ,if u r investing in OnePlus then don't invest in this mid range or so called budget ones, it's just waste of time and money..
Invest in it's flagship phones or go for better devices of Realme and other brands !

6. During day time heating problem while taking pictures or making video, i observe nokia 6.1 plus is all time cool, nokia has big issue- software problems, charger problems, jack problems otherwise nokia is better than Apple.
7. Battery is awesome better than nokia or other mobile phone but drain very fast even not using internet connection.
8. Look is awesome but bigger than hand so may be fall during call.
9. one plus gave cover free of cost but there is no protection for camera.

AH3XJXJTFRPXAIWMWRRJUGSO22DQ,B09WQY65HN,Rohini Thorat,"I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G this year, and unfortunately, I can't say that I'm satisfied with my purchase. While OnePlus has garnered a reputation for delivering high-quality products, my experience with this phone has been quite the opposite.

Performance and Value for Money:
The phone's performance fell short of my expectations. Given the premium price tag, I anticipated a seamless and lightning-fast experience. However, the device frequently lagged and struggled to keep up with everyday tasks. This, in my opinion, doesn't justify the high cost.

Build Quality:
I was also disappointed with the build quality. For a phone in this price range, I expected a more premium feel. Instead, the phone feels rather flimsy, and I'm concerned about its durability over time.

Camera Quality:
One of the major selling points of OnePlus phones has always been their camera quality. Unfortunately, the camera left a lot to be desired. The photos often lacked detail and struggled in low-light conditions. It's a far cry from the stellar camera performance I was hoping for.

Features and Cost:
Considering the price of the phone, I expected a robust set of features. However, I found that this model had fewer features compared to some of its competitors in the same price range. It felt like I was paying a premium for the brand name rather than for the features and capabilities.

In conclusion, my experience with the OnePlus Nord CE 2 has left me disappointed. It doesn't live up to the OnePlus brand's reputation for providing value for money. The performance, build quality, camera, and features all fall short of expectations, especially when considering the cost. I regret my purchase and would advise potential buyers to explore other options in this price range.",2.0,Disappointing Experience with OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800
AE6EZR523UAFPU4C3W7YJEGYIBKQ,B09WQY65HN,Arunava Chatterjee,"Bought it 19 August. Regretting since 20 August.

Took me a while to figure out how to start Android Auto by default when plugged into a car (you have to manually enable Android Auto the first time). First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn't pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to ""Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos"". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.

When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn't work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don't always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 ""monster of a chipset"", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn't order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.

When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don't have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.

When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.

There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren't on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).

Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it's better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones. I don't know about other OnePlus models but this one is a disaster.

2. Heated up while playing a game especially ""rocket league"". Had to uninstall it

5. Sometimes when I open up a website and zoom in on any picture, then it becomes a task to zoom it out or sometimes even scrolling becomes a big no. And i have to reload the webpage to zoom out from it.

But touch sensitivity is all good and a good phone which meets your basic expectation within 25k.
One plus could have given more focus on resolving the heating issues for this type of flagship phone. And its light weight phone (173 gm) which is easy to carry and handle. Screen size (6.43 inches) is also standard which is enough for viewing videos and chatting. Overall if you are fine with heating issues then its a good option within 25k budget.",2.0,Bad product.

AGTIOQWBYUNDUVS5NBARCRONM47A,B09WQY65HN,Y H.,"Camera: 1/5 rating
Camera is terrible! I don't usually use camera at all. So, I don't have huge expectations on that department. Yet, it managed to go below those minimum expectations as well. The camera is way below the quality of redmi note 11 (my previous phone) and you can't even install gcam as it's mediatek processor in Nord ce 2.

Battery: Charges fast and discharges quickly as well. I can give 3/5 rating as it charges under 30 minutes by compensating the average battery backup.

Display: 3/5 rating
It doesn't seem like a high quality display. I think redmi note 11's (my previous phone) amoled display is better and brighter than this. But, It is an amoled display after all, you can expect good contrast, punchy colours in Nord ce 2 as well.

Performance: 4/5 rating
No lag, No heat, Works very well in day to day tasks. Gaming is also good for heavy gamers but just don't compare it with flagship phones.

2. Due to omnivison camera, picture quality is not good in low light.. Okayish camera
3. No inbuilt app for messages, dialer, recorder, notes.. All are google based apps
4. MAJOR problem- It has google CALL RECORDER by default.. If you record during call ""it will prompt recording has started"" which can be heard to both caller and receiver.. I mean people use Call recorder for safety and secure purpose, but here it is opposite
5. If you turn on WiFi hotspot for more than 10 15 minutes,it will start showing heating issue
6. After software update, for twice my audio was not working, had to restart again
7. Battery drains fast in ambient display mode..
8. Did not find any difference in power saving mode aa compare to normal mode.. Battery drains in same speed in both mode..
9. I mean its 2022, then why android 11?

AFTWS74E6DSPT2NV4XYLR7ZOQXUQ,B09WQY65HN,Akhilesh B Chandran,"Was having high expectations while buying. I own a Samsung S20 FE 5G and this OnePlus Nord CE2 was bought as a gift for mom. I should say that I was disappointed. There is a slight lag issue(many already reported, which I ignored while buying).

Another thing I noticed is that, the call recording feature is hectic. Like the new phones, it starts the recording after the voice warning. But my S20 FE doesn't warn like this.
Another thing is, the auto call recording can be enabled for all non-saved numbers, but for contacts saved in your phone, you would have to manually add them one by one to the list so that auto-recording would happen. That's the most stupid thing. Because most of us would have 1000s of contacts. And adding them one by one to the list for auto-call recording is a tedious task.

Another issue is, the camera is way too below average. Expected a better camera from this phone.

When I installed online update on phone, the phone started to give issue in Bluetooth connectivity. When I visited oneplus service center they told that this had Bluetooth 5.0 which may have difficulty while connecting with lower Bluetooth version devices. Obviously they were trying to make some lame excuses. Then after few days I observed my contacts in phone which were linked to Google Account got deleted on its own. When I checked phone, it was also not showing option to save contact no. in device memory. Means phone os where not showing option to save no. In device memory and only showing option to save no. On Google account. Now I understood the reason of sudden disappearance of contacts from phone. This phone has deleted my contacts in sync from Google account also. Also, I observed my photos got disappeared from gallery on its own. I know this may sound crazy but all this happened in real. I visited multiple times to service center but they just reinstalled software and couldn't able to resolve the issue. Infact When they saw this issue initially they denied about any such issue.when I insisted and shown my frustration then they logged my complaint. Even if they were not able to resolve my issue they closed my complaint in their system. I also wrote to oneplus to which I did not received reply till date. During my visits to service centers I observed huge crowd with various issue in all oneplus devices. Even there high end products above 40k have lot of issues and lot of customers where in deep frustration. I request all the buyers out there to not purchase any oneplus product. The company product quality has down graded a lot. And they don't provide any aftersales support.

They informed me, you might have dropped the phone. I said phone is not dropped and it does not have any scratch. Later authorised person mentioned may be you would have kept mobile in tight jeans pocket and it might be the reason for it to get bend. I have been using mobile phone from past 15 years.

My second mobile phone I did not use it for a while and 7 days of exchange time was lapsed, when I started using this device I am facing a lot of issue with the proximity sensor with this device which is nightmare.

Firstly coming down to camera: The camera quality is pathetic, my old phone with much less price than this takes better photographs and videos.
This phone captures no details still generates huge size photo for nothing but taking up space. Zoom level is only 6x.
Video lags too much while recording and playing, the microphone levels are so unadjusted.
If you were thinking of buying this for camera, just back off and get something else.

Now coming to the networks, this phone has a lot of problems with it. Networks keeps dropping in between, you won't even know if you miss any important call or communication because of this.
I thought this is only limited to my set, but after seeing the reviews seems like this device model has this problem.

I had heard a lot of good this about Oneplus from my friends and family and was excited to get the phone.
But on using the phone for a few days, I was left unsatisfied with the cameras. I personally use the Pixel 4a, and despite the pixel having a lesser resolution camera, it outshines the CE2. I was ok with that, because well, pixel is pixel. But, then the most bizarre thing happened. One fine day, the camera app stopped working completely (crashes at launch). Tried all the basic trouble shooting steps recommended by Oneplus, but nothing worked. The flashlight toggle in the notification shade was also greyed out with the message 'camera in use', even after resetting the device completely.
At this point, I booked a service request with the care app and sent it for repair. Got the device back in a week, working properly. But to my surprise, after a week of use, the same problem has happened again.

I am extremely disappointed and frustrated at this point. This was not expected from Oneplus as a brand.

Every time mobile gets hang & screen automatically gets on & off, no function & unlock w can be done after that.

Sound quality was very very bad in speaker & earpiece, also next person was not able to hear clear voice.

I was out of station when received mobile online, opened box exactly after return policy day expire, ie. exactly on 7th day of receiving mobile parcel. And so I was not eligible to return or refund it.

AG2JNINMJRH77VYOXTR5DRQK6PNQ,B09WQY65HN,Deepak,"I had been using one plus 5T for the last 4 years and was highly satisfied. But for some reason needed to upgrade to Android 12. Nord CE 2 lite seems the perfect option given that it was coming from brand one plus. It won't be fair to compare my 5T with this given the price range. But let me list few things which one plus completely degraded
1. The camera quality - worse. 64MP is just on paper. The photos pixalates even when taken in bright sunlight. Highly downgraded from one plus standards.
2. Fingerprint sensors - they merged the fingerprint sensor with the power button. It has definately complicated the whole functionality. Firstly there's less space to read fingerprints, which leads to unresponsive sensors. And secondly it messes up big time. Lot of confusion while pressing the power button - whether it'll unlock or just woke up tye screen. Most of the time my phone is vibrating on accidentally touching the button.
3. Processor - One plus is aggresive in cost cutting. Shifted even the flagship phones to mediatek. Thankfully this one still comes with Snapdragon, but a 6 series one. Does the job, but is not as smooth as you expect from one plus.
4. Overall it feels like a oppo, vivo phone more than a one plus phone. Just a mid series average phone commanding a higer price tag just for the brand one plus.",1.0,Not the one plus experience,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800

You visit, they give you false reasons and won't repair your phone.

Even their management is silent too. I have written many emails to higher management but they seem not interested in customer issues rather than enjoying their life with customers' money they fooled customers and sold their products having issues. They do not listen to customers and keep mum. They are putting the money in their pocket from customers and no support to customers.

Final review;- go if you're getting under 17k but keep in mind display is good but you'll get only 1080p in yt ,no heating issues,battery performance is also good,if your budget is tight and looking for brand value you can go for it.

AF64W2XMKVM2OD4RTXJTPMDE7Q2Q,B09WQY65HN,Abhinav,"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.
There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.
Pros:
1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.
2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet
3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.
4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.
Cons
1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.

Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.

AFB2FWPDSV3IQLNYYHJBPUFIQEWQ,B09WQY65HN,anju," Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matter

Display - Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as well

Performance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usage

Software- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos üòÇ but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better idea

Camera - Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent things

Battery - Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fast

Speakers - 6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate

5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristic

Call quality - Rating 10 : it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbled

So to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",4.0,A decent package for non gamers and everything thing is decent not the best out there,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800

AH3XJXJTFRPXAIWMWRRJUGSO22DQ,B09WQY65HN,Rohini Thorat,"I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G this year, and unfortunately, I can't say that I'm satisfied with my purchase. While OnePlus has garnered a reputation for delivering high-quality products, my experience with this phone has been quite the opposite.

Performance and Value for Money:
The phone's performance fell short of my expectations. Given the premium price tag, I anticipated a seamless and lightning-fast experience. However, the device frequently lagged and struggled to keep up with everyday tasks. This, in my opinion, doesn't justify the high cost.

Build Quality:
I was also disappointed with the build quality. For a phone in this price range, I expected a more premium feel. Instead, the phone feels rather flimsy, and I'm concerned about its durability over time.

Camera Quality:
One of the major selling points of OnePlus phones has always been their camera quality. Unfortunately, the camera left a lot to be desired. The photos often lacked detail and struggled in low-light conditions. It's a far cry from the stellar camera performance I was hoping for.

Features and Cost:
Considering the price of the phone, I expected a robust set of features. However, I found that this model had fewer features compared to some of its competitors in the same price range. It felt like I was paying a premium for the brand name rather than for the features and capabilities.

In conclusion, my experience with the OnePlus Nord CE 2 has left me disappointed. It doesn't live up to the OnePlus brand's reputation for providing value for money. The performance, build quality, camera, and features all fall short of expectations, especially when considering the cost. I regret my purchase and would advise potential buyers to explore other options in this price range.",2.0,Disappointing Experience with OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800
AE4CY57AQH24XJIV7FHHDR7VIORQ,B09WQY65HN,Suhit,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of Usage

Design: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.

Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.

Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.

Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.

Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.

Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.

AE6EZR523UAFPU4C3W7YJEGYIBKQ,B09WQY65HN,Arunava Chatterjee,"Bought it 19 August. Regretting since 20 August.

Took me a while to figure out how to start Android Auto by default when plugged into a car (you have to manually enable Android Auto the first time). First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn't pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to ""Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos"". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.

When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn't work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don't always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 ""monster of a chipset"", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn't order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.

When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don't have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.

When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.

There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren't on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).

Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it's better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones. I don't know about other OnePlus models but this one is a disaster.

It's superb but the video cam is not even satisfying, it's so blurry and then as soon as you zoom in - boom your quality degraded heavenly.

It is nothing more than a Realme inform of a OnePlus phone. Position of speakers, camera, camera quality, UI everything. Realme and OnePlus has the same parent company so the user interface are 90 percent same. And it is not clean Android. I had to let go my Nokia 6.1 plus for this, I am regretting now. Camera quality is average. Better to buy a OnePlus phone of higher range and in this range you get nothing. It seems like OnePlus launched this phone in this range just for marketing purposes only.

AFVY4MVXNFOOQD4G7YJ7VYDJJ7OA,B09WQY65HN,Harsh Bakshi,"Hi this is honest review after almost 1 month of usage. I recently purchased oneplus nord ce2 lite. It had issues since the day I purchased. When I installed online update on phone, the phone started to give issue in Bluetooth connectivity. When I visited oneplus service center they told that this had Bluetooth 5.0 which may have difficulty while connecting with lower Bluetooth version devices. Obviously they were trying to make some lame excuses. Then after few days I observed my contacts in phone which were linked to Google Account got deleted on its own. When I checked phone, it was also not showing option to save contact no. in device memory. Means phone os where not showing option to save no. In device memory and only showing option to save no. On Google account. Now I understood the reason of sudden disappearance of contacts from phone. This phone has deleted my contacts in sync from Google account also. Also, I observed my photos got disappeared from gallery on its own. I know this may sound crazy but all this happened in real. I visited multiple times to service center but they just reinstalled software and couldn't able to resolve the issue. Infact When they saw this issue initially they denied about any such issue.when I insisted and shown my frustration then they logged my complaint. Even if they were not able to resolve my issue they closed my complaint in their system. I also wrote to oneplus to which I did not received reply till date. During my visits to service centers I observed huge crowd with various issue in all oneplus devices. Even there high end products above 40k have lot of issues and lot of customers where in deep frustration. I request all the buyers out there to not purchase any oneplus product. The company product quality has down graded a lot. And they don't provide any aftersales support. Please save your hard earned money from purchasing oneplus product.",1.0,Oneplus is fraud company,Reviewed in India on 21 July 2023,1689877800
